# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview

Training and evaluating unbalanced credit and loan risk with data preparation, statistical reasoning and machine learning. 
To do this we:
- Oversampled the data usingg RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms. 
- Undersampled the data using ClusterCentroid algorithms. 
- Used the SMOTEENN algorithm as a cominbined under and over sampling approach.
- Compared machine learning models BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to reduce bias in our predictions. 

## Resources

- Data Source: LoanStats_2019Q.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.8.3
